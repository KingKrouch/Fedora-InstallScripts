# Set up Screen mirroring for Android devices. You can make a V4L2 loopback for OBS Studio.
``sudo dnf copr enable zeno/scrcpy && sudo dnf install scrcpy -y``
``sudo modprobe v4l2loopback``
First, make sure the Android device is plugged in over USB and set to File Transfer Mode.
Use ``v4l2-ctl --listdevices`` to check for the V4L2 device and what ``/dev/videoX`` device it uses.
Use ``scrcpy --v4l2-sink=/dev/videoX --no-video-playback`` for when you don't want the playback window opened.
For example, it would be ``scrcpy --v4l2-sink=/dev/video7 --no-video-playback --serial SERIALNO`` for me.
You can find your device serial number by using the ``adb devices`` command.
